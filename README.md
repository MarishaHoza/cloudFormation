# File 1:
* Error: during yml file upload, we could not progress to the next step because of an "invalid alphanumeric error" on the s3 bucket name
* Bug: bucket name was kebab-case
* Resolution: changed to camelCase
* PR: no, not pushing my github key thankyou
* [Front End](http://template1-coolreactbucket-qg9efn7xcu76.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/)

We reviewed additional yml files for errors. Found some missing sections and keywords, but did not create additional pipelines.
